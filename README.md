personality and academic research. Social media data reflects
people’s traits through their posts at different times. Text mining
can be used to unravel hidden topics in the individuals’ post
which may reflect their state of mind.

In this text mining(Facebook posts) project:

on “emolex” corpus 
2. treat the processed emotions as
predictors to predict BigFive personality through various
algorithms (General Lineal Model, Adaboost, Decision Tree,)
